"""Lesson 02 â€“ Numerical Computing with NumPy and Pandas.

Objectives
----------
- Become comfortable with vectorised operations in NumPy.
- Understand tabular data manipulations with Pandas DataFrames.
- Learn idiomatic patterns for filtering, aggregating, and reshaping data.

Running the module executes short demonstrations that showcase the material.
