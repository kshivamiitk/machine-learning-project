# Machine Learning Sequential Curriculum

This repository now contains a comprehensive, sequential curriculum for learning machine learning with Python. The material is organised as a series of Python lesson files located in the `lessons/` directory. Each lesson can be executed directly to run the embedded demonstrations, while the top-level docstrings and comments explain the theory, workflow, and best practices in depth.

## How to Use the Lessons
1. Work through the lessons in numerical order (`lesson01` onwards). Each lesson builds upon concepts introduced previously.
2. Read through the module docstrings and inline comments for explanations and context.
3. Run the lessons with `python lessons/lessonXX_*.py` to execute the illustrative examples.
4. Experiment by modifying the code and observing how the changes affect the results.

## Lesson Overview
- **Lesson 01:** Python and scientific-computing essentials for machine learning.
- **Lesson 02:** Core numerical tools with NumPy and Pandas.
- **Lesson 03:** Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- **Lesson 04:** Supervised learning algorithms and workflows.
- **Lesson 05:** Model evaluation, validation strategies, and metrics.
- **Lesson 06:** Feature engineering and pipelines for reproducible preprocessing.
- **Lesson 07:** Unsupervised learning techniques.
- **Lesson 08:** Deep learning fundamentals with NumPy-based neural networks.
- **Lesson 09:** Model deployment considerations and practical guidance.

Each lesson includes references to additional resources for further study and encourages experimentation to deepen understanding.
