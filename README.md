# Machine Learning and MERN Stack Curricula

This repository now hosts two sequential learning tracks:

1. **Machine Learning with Python** — a series of executable Python lessons in `lessons/`.
2. **MERN Stack Development** — a collection of lesson directories under `mern_lessons/`, each containing a detailed `README.md` guide.

Both tracks are designed to be completed in order. Each lesson builds upon previous concepts and includes practical exercises to reinforce learning.

## How to Use the Machine Learning Lessons
1. Navigate to the `lessons/` directory.
2. Work through the files in numerical order (`lesson01_*.py` through `lesson09_*.py`).
3. Run lessons with `python lessons/lessonXX_topic.py` to execute the embedded demonstrations.
4. Experiment by modifying the code and observing how changes affect the output.

# Machine Learning Sequential Curriculum

This repository now contains a comprehensive, sequential curriculum for learning machine learning with Python. The material is organised as a series of Python lesson files located in the `lessons/` directory. Each lesson can be executed directly to run the embedded demonstrations, while the top-level docstrings and comments explain the theory, workflow, and best practices in depth.

## How to Use the Lessons
1. Work through the lessons in numerical order (`lesson01` onwards). Each lesson builds upon concepts introduced previously.
2. Read through the module docstrings and inline comments for explanations and context.
3. Run the lessons with `python lessons/lessonXX_*.py` to execute the illustrative examples.
4. Experiment by modifying the code and observing how the changes affect the results.

## Lesson Overview
- **Lesson 01:** Python and scientific-computing essentials for machine learning.
- **Lesson 02:** Core numerical tools with NumPy and Pandas.
- **Lesson 03:** Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- **Lesson 04:** Supervised learning algorithms and workflows.
- **Lesson 05:** Model evaluation, validation strategies, and metrics.
- **Lesson 06:** Feature engineering and pipelines for reproducible preprocessing.
- **Lesson 07:** Unsupervised learning techniques.
- **Lesson 08:** Deep learning fundamentals with NumPy-based neural networks.
- **Lesson 09:** Model deployment considerations and practical guidance.

## How to Use the MERN Lessons
1. Navigate to the `mern_lessons/` directory.
2. Open each lesson folder (e.g., `lesson01_overview_setup/`) and read the `README.md` inside.
3. Follow the guided explanations, code samples, and exercises sequentially from Lesson 01 through Lesson 09.
4. Apply the exercises to the evolving MERN project scaffolded in Lesson 01.

## MERN Lesson Overview
- **Lesson 01:** MERN stack overview and environment setup.
- **Lesson 02:** Node.js and Express fundamentals.
- **Lesson 03:** MongoDB configuration and data modeling basics.
- **Lesson 04:** RESTful API design with Express and Mongoose.
- **Lesson 05:** React fundamentals with modern tooling.
- **Lesson 06:** Full-stack integration and state synchronization.
- **Lesson 07:** Authentication, authorization, and security hardening.
- **Lesson 08:** Testing strategy and quality assurance.
- **Lesson 09:** Deployment, monitoring, and operational excellence.

Each MERN lesson README includes objectives, prerequisites, implementation snippets, and exercises to extend the project further.
Each lesson includes references to additional resources for further study and encourages experimentation to deepen understanding.
